# Your Recipes
Team: Duy Nguyen, Joseph Pidgeon, Omran Farighi, Brandon Lokey

## Project Overview

People eat everyday and it is surprising that not a lot of people keeping track of what we are putting in our bodies, how much calories did we have for the day, how much fat we should have, etc. This web based app will solve that problem for us by providing the user the information of the dishes we are having. In addition, the app can also give you quick answer on how much vitamin C is in an apple, for example. Not stopping there, if you ever feel stuck thinking about what to make at home this app can also generate a recipe for you with all the information you need so you don't have to scratch your head and waste your time thinking.
