# Your Recipes
Team: Duy Nguyen, Joseph Pidgeon, Omran Farighi, Brandon Lokey

## Project Overview

People eat everyday and it is surprising that not a lot of people keeping track of what we are putting in our bodies, how much calories did we have for the day, how much fat we should have, etc. This web based app will solve that problem for us by providing the user the information of the dishes we are having. In addition, the app can also give you quick answer on how much vitamin C is in an apple, for example. Not stopping there, if you ever feel stuck thinking about what to make at home this app can also generate a recipe for you with all the information you need so you don't have to scratch your head and waste your time thinking.

## Vision Statement


## Personas

### Persona 1 (Duy Nguyen)

### Persona 2 (Omran Farighi)

### Persona 3 (Joseph Pideon)

Alex, age 20, is a student in his third year at Temple University (college) in Philadelphia. He is studying criminal justice. He was born in Alexandria, Virginia where he went to elementary school. After elementary school he moved to Allison Park, Pennsylvania, with his family and graduated from Hampton High School. He enjoys cooking and meal prepping so that he has a nutritious and balanced diet to get through the days.

Alex usually uses google to find recipes that he wants to prepare for the week but finds it troublesome to account for the nutrition information. He often finds good recipes that he will want to cook again but wants an alternative to saving or bookmarking the recipes on his computer. He might use the Your Recipes application for recipe organization and for logging nutrition information if it is automated.
